<hr>

When I started doing this problem my main goal was getting experience and to be able to explain whatver I learnt on the way. I'm still learning and trying to improve my skills, so every feedback and advices are welcome !
<br><br>
In this notebook I will try to show how to build a Digit Recognizer using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and will try to explain each step. If you are a beginner then this is the Notebook for you !

### Here are the things I will try to cover in this Notebook:

- What does our data look like ?
- What model should we choose or build?
- Which optimization technique to use?
- What is data augmentation ? Will it help in increasing the accuracy of our model?
- Is it possible to achieve 100% accuracy?

### Steps for making this project : 

All the steps are already written in the along with the code in the notebook !

### Note :
If you do come across any doubts or problem feel free to ask!

### If you like this kernel feel free to star ‚≠ê and leave feedback, thanks!
